The Admin Panel application is an interface for the administrator/owner of a company, electronic service, etc. All statistical data and tasks are retrieved from a json-server, which must be started before testing the application. The base URL is defined as https://localhost:3000, so the json server should be run on port 3000 (yarn run json-server [path])

The application uses the following frameworks, which are described in more detail in the package.json file (The application uses the VITE bundler and Babel):

- react
- react-router
- redux
- tanstack-query
- yup
- react-hook-forms
- mui-material
- dayjs
- json-server
- recharts
